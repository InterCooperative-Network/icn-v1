## PROJECT STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### Repository Structure

``` 
[Structure redacted for brevity in this view — use the user-provided tree as canonical]
```

### AI Agent Development Rules

#### Core Principles
1. Democratic First
2. Cooperative Autonomy
3. Transparent by Default
4. Federation not Centralization
5. Member-Controlled Technology

#### Technical Standards
- Code quality: tests (≥80% coverage), integration, E2E; TS strict mode; Python PEP8+Black; OpenAPI for all public APIs
- Security: input validation, parameterized queries, XSS/CSRF protection, externalized secrets, network policies
- Democratic governance: thresholds trigger workflows; multiple models; immutable audit trail; member verification; threaded discussions
- Federation: independent operation on partition; trust-aware comms; data sovereignty; standard APIs; graceful degradation

#### Development Workflow
- Before starting: read specs, understand democratic requirements, map service impacts, plan governance implications
- Implementation: tests-first; document decision points; semantic commits; update API docs; consider accessibility
- Code review: tests and scans green; verify workflows; measure performance; verify a11y; update docs

#### Cooperative Context Understanding
- Roles: Individual Members, Cooperative Admins, Network Participants, Democratic Delegates
- Economic events: Resource Sharing, Labor Exchange, Knowledge Transfer, Mutual Aid, Infrastructure Investment
- Governance models: Consensus, Consensus Minus One, Majority, Supermajority, Sociocratic Circles
